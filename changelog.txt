---------------------
  + Fix: divide by zero when production is zero.
  + Doxygen documentation improvements.
  + Use https links.
  + Use python3 for making releases.

Version 8, 2019-09-19
---------------------
+ Fix: Determination of 90 degree turn in rail pathfinder was wrong causing
  rollercoaster tracks and difficulties finding a path.
+ Fix: Remove rail tracks by using RemoveRailTrack as much as possible since
  that is cheaper than using DemolishTile which makes it less likely that we
  run out of money early in the game with a failed train route.
+ Fix: Not building airports in spots where the noise level will equal the
  maximum allowed noise level.
+ Fix: Take station spread setting into account when determining best
  airport type.
+ Add: Manage over saturated air routes by either removing planes from route
  or upgrading airports.
+ Add: Upgrade airports to International airports in certain cases.
+ Add: Regular checks that industries we use on a rail route are still
  accepting/producing our cargo. If not we will sell the vehicles and
  close the route.
+ Add: Extra pathfinding penalties to make it less likely the pathfinder
  continues a path far away from our destination.
+ Change: Improve finding airport spots adding towns to blacklist more
  often and only checking towns within distance limits.
+ Change: Adjust max aircraft route distance in early starting games
  depending on plane speed and reliability.
+ Change: Rail: Increase length of train routes if we have enough money.
+ Change: Lower minimum town for airport size in easy setting from 2500
  to 1500.
+ Change: Use Graph.AyStar version 6 instead of version 4.
+ Change: Moved repository and issue tracker to Github.

Version 7, 2017-04-16
---------------------
+ Fix: Not checking air route range at startup under certain conditions.
+ Change: Adjust maximum distance for air routes when we have limited money.
+ Change: Adjust airCraft selection when we have limited funds and high prices
  of longer range aircraft.

Version 6, 2016-05-28
---------------------
+ Fix: Crash when loading a savegame saved when building a rail route or
  when replacing trains.
+ Fix: Crash when we get loaded into a savegame without getting any saved data.
+ Fix: We need to make sure we have at least some money to build a rail route.
+ Fix: Make sure that the vehicle we share orders with is valid.
+ Fix: 90 degree turns near a passing lane.
+ Fix: border of map starts at 1,1 not 0,0. (We were not building airports
  in towns near the left and upper borders.)
+ Change: more checks before building a passing lane, we should see less land
  is sloped wrong messages.
+ Change: Improved airport upgrading.
+ Change: Better handling of airplane NewGRF's that have high prices.
+ Change: Rail pathfinding tweaks.
+ Change: Don't cancel and remove routes just because we don't have money for
  vehicles. Just add them later when we do have the money.
+ Change: Don't use airplanes that are hardly profitable.
+ Change: Blacklist airports that we failed to upgrade for a while.

Version 5, 2016-05-14
---------------------
+ Add: Train support. Based on SimpleAI but with changes and more to come.
+ Change: Take inflation into account.
+ Change: blacklist towns where we failed to build an airport for a while.
+ Change: Don't remove airports we just built if we don't have money
  to buy the airplanes. We build them later when we have the money.
+ Change: Don't waste time trying to upgrade airport if there's too much noise.

Version 4, 2016-04-30
---------------------
+ Fix: Airplanes could get stuck when an airport upgrade failed.
+ Fix: After loading a savegame that had airplanes stopped in depot
  to be sold WormAI didn't know about them being in depot and
  tried to send them to depot again which failed causing them
  to not be sold.
+ Add: Build HeadQuarters (normal or fast setting).
+ Add: Build Statues in towns with an airport (fast setting only).
+ Change: Updated SuperLib to latest version (39).

---------------------
+ Add basic support for upgrading airports.
+ Fix: Don't use large aircraft on small airports.
+ Fix: Don't crash when there isn't a best engine at all.
+ Change: Don't add more airplanes to a route when there are
  too many planes waiting in the landing queue.
+ Change how we are starting tasks. Do it monthly/yearly instead
  of based on a tick count.
