Version 6, 2016-05-28
---------------------
+ Fix: Crash when loading a savegame saved when building a rail route or
  when replacing trains.
+ Fix: Crash when we get loaded into a savegame without getting any saved data.

+ Fix: Make sure that the vehicle we share orders with is valid.
+ Fix: 90 degree turns near a passing lane.
+ Fix: border of map starts at 1,1 not 0,0. (We were not building airports
  in towns near the left and upper borders.)

  is sloped wrong messages.
+ Change: Improved airport upgrading.
+ Change: Better handling of airplane NewGRF's that have high prices.

---------------------
+ Fix: Airplanes could get stuck when an airport upgrade failed.
